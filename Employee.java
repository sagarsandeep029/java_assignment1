//Q.6: Write a program, creating a class which contains a method that would print the information (name, year of joining, salary, address) of three employees by creating a class named 'Employee'. The output should be as follows:
//Name Year of joining Address
//Robert 1994 64C- WallStreet
//Sam 2000 68D- WallStreet
//John 1999 26B- WallStreet
